# data_structure_programs
Ruby programs defining data structures and their basic functionalities
1. Linked List
  List of operations covered: 
    - is_empty? #checks if the list is empty
    - push # adds a new at the END
    - unshift # adds a new node in the FRONT
    - pop # removes a node from the END
    - shift #removes a node from the FRONT
    - size # returns the length of the LL
    - pretty_print # returns the data from the linked list in an array format

2. Unique linked list
   Given a LL with data 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5 , return a ll with 1 -> 2 -> 5
